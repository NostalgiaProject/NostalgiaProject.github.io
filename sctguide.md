Latest version of SCT at the time of writing: **Release 1.2.0 / Beta 1.3.0**

**Please note:** Simple Classic Theme is licensed under GPLv3. It comes with no warranty whatsoever. Keep in mind that if anything breaks while following this guide, you are responsible yourself. WinClassic is a small community of people that aims to keep Classic theme alive as much as possible and who will happily help if you're running into trouble with something but we can't guarantee to solve your problem.

## Table of contents

1. [**Use the SCT Wizard to configure CT (Recommended)**](#wizard)<br>
   Use the interactive wizard inside SCT to configure it to your liking. This allows for all options listed under here.

2. [**Classic Theme with SCT and SCT Taskbar (Recommended)**](#sctt)<br>
    Only use SCT software to install Classic Theme. SCT will manage loading Classic Theme and SCT Taskbar will be used to replace the Windows taskbar

3. [**Classic Theme with SCT and StartIsBack++ combined with Open-Shell**](#sibos)<br>
    Use SCT's built-in configuration tool to install Classic Theme and StartIsBack++/Open-Shell for the taskbar.

4. [**Classic Theme with SCT and a custom taskbar**](#customtb)<br>
    Use SCT for managing Classic Theme at boot and on restarts, and use your own solution for the taskbar.

5. [**Don't use SCT and its feature set**]()<br>
    You can go to the quickstart guide linked above for additional methods for Classic Theme, not using SCT

## Simple Classic Theme Wizard ("The Classic Theme Installer")
**Note:** The Wizard is a recent addition to SCT. This means that it might contain some unresolved bugs.

Firstly you need to [download SimpleClassicTheme from Github](https://github.com/WinClassic/SimpleClassicTheme/releases/latest/download/SimpleClassicTheme.exe).<br>
Open the file you just downloaded and press Yes on the UAC prompt.<br>
If it's the first time you're running SCT you will be asked if you want to run the wizard. Press Yes.<br>
If it's not the first time, you can click File -> Launch Wizard inside SCT to run the wizard.<br>
The wizard should open. It will look something like this:<br>
